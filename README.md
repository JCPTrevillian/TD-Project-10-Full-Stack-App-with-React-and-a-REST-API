Full Stack App with React and a REST API 

In this 2/2 two-part Javasript Full Stack capstone project, I used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (that I created in part 1/2, U9, a previous project). This full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. 

Users can interact with the database by: 
1. Retrieving a list of courses
2. Viewing detail for a specific course 
3. Create, update and/or delete courses in the database.

This project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database with React. 

To complete this project, I used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

This is the second of a two-part capstone project of a fully functional Javascript full stack application (front-end client and back-end server). 




To run: 
1. download project
2. open terminal, navigate to api/
3. npm install
5. npm run seed
6. npm start

**Open a separate terminal** 
1. navigate to client/
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. your browser should open to 'localhost:3000/
