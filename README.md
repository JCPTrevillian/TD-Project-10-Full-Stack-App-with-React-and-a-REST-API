Full Stack App with React and a REST API 

In this 2/2 two-part Javasript Full Stack capstone project, I used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (that I created in part 1/2, U9, a previous project). This full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

This project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database with React. 

To complete this project, I used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

This is the second of a two-part capstone project of a fully functional Javascript full stack application (front-end client and back-end server).
